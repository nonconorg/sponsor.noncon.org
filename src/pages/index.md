## Tier "Presented by"
### (One Slot @ 20,020 Euros)

We don't need this "Ultra Tier" amount to produce the event,
the sponsor tiers below will cover that.

This is about Prestige, Honor, and Recognition.

The Institution, Foundation, Product (or Whale) that sponsor this slot
does so because they recognize the skillset, values,
and goals of the Parallele Polis Team,
and want to support their efforts for the rest of the 2020 calendar year.
We won't accept this contribution from just ANYONE though. We'll have to respect you too.

There is no booth, workshop, or other services offered for this slot
beyond visual branding in meatspace and cyber-cyberspace.
The only Perk is that we will carry the commitment over to
the main Parallele Polis website,
and all venues we work and produce events in this year.

It's essentially a Grant,
with no strings attached because you trust us to use the donation wisely,
in part to compensate our volunteers during the event,
and to give the speakers a token amount to cover their costs.
